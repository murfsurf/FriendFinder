# FriendFinder
Homework Assignment for Friend Finder Survey
This assignment did not use a sql database, but rather the data was hard-coded into the html page and the form (survey) interacted with the data.  The images for the friends' links worked on the first pass through, but stopped working after the first time.

The routes were a bit tricky but ultimately I managed to stumble into a way to get them to work.

I was fully unclear on the Heroku aspect of this assignment and thus will include screen shots as in previous assignments.
